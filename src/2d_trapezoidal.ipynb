    "Grid method: We make the decision to fix $n^y_i$ across $x_i$ values. That is, for step (1) above, rather than change the number of subintervals as the interval $[g(x_i),h(x_i)]$ changes, we will simply change the size of these intervals. This may have a strange effect on the convergence / error bounds, but it will simplify our computations a great deal. We store this variable as 'ny' below. Indeed, we intend to iterate in an unevenly spaced grid, so we will have n = nx = ny.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will proceed with our attempted convergence algorithm by doubling n at each step. Observe that as we do this, we effectively square the number of points at which we interpolate. In our previous 1-D trapezoidal integrator, storing old function values cut down on total function evaluations by 50%, but, because of this squaring, keeping old evaluations only cuts down on total function evaluations by 25%. \n",
    "\n",
    "We also run into another problem: boundary points of the domain may not be amenable to our dividing method. Consider the right quarter circle; for $x_i=1$, we can have at most $ny=1$. Our solution could be to avoid splitting up the boundary. However, in the case below, we allow our integrator to attempt to divide the integral [1,1] into n subintervals at each step, observing that this should produce $F(1) \\approx 0$ as desired. "

We would like to preserve the 'power of two' injection we were doing before that allowed us to place our new interpolation points at the odd incides of our next array. Hence, we will initialize each new $n_y^i$ as $$n^y_{i,0} = \\max\\{1,n_x 2^{\\lceil \\log_2(\\frac{h_i-g_i}{b-a})\\rceil}\\}    .$$ Then, at each step, we will double each $n^y_i$ as before, so $n_{i,k}^y = 2n_{i,k-1}^y$.
