First, we compute $$(1) \\ \\ \\ \\  F(x_i) = \\int_{g(x_i)}^{h(x_i)}f(x_i,y)dy.$$ Then, we 'integrate' (ie apply our weighted sums) to the resultant $F$ values over $x$, via $$(2) \\ \\ \\ \\ \\int\\int_{\\Omega} f(x,y)dydx = \\int_a^bF(x)dx.$$"

    "For our method, we make the decision to fix $n^y_i$ across $x_i$ values. That is, for step (1) above, rather than change the number of subintervals as the interval $[g(x_i),h(x_i)]$ changes, we will simply change the size of these intervals. This may have a strange effect on the convergence / error bounds, but it will simplify our computations a great deal. We store this variable as 'ny' below. Indeed, we intend to iterate in an unevenly spaced grid, so we will have n = nx = ny.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will proceed with our attempted convergence algorithm by doubling n at each step. Observe that as we do this, we effectively square the number of points at which we interpolate. In our previous 1-D trapezoidal integrator, storing old function values cut down on total function evaluations by 50%, but, because of this squaring, keeping old evaluations only cuts down on total function evaluations by 25%. \n",
    "\n",
    "We also run into another problem: boundary points of the domain may not be amenable to our dividing method. Consider the right quarter circle; for $x_i=1$, we can have at most $ny=1$. Our solution could be to avoid splitting up the boundary. However, in the case below, we allow our integrator to attempt to divide the integral [1,1] into n subintervals at each step, observing that this should produce $F(1) \\approx 0$ as desired. "
