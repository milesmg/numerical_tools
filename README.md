### A few applied math tools. 

In /src, you'll find:
- a notebook that plays around with Newton interpolation, a type of polynomial interpolation, and explores some limitations and extensions of the basic technique.
- a notebook that deals with Lagrange interpolation
- a notebook that has three methods of integrating functions in one dimension (that is $f:\mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}.$)
- a notebook that has to difference approaches to a trapezoidal integrator in two dimensions (that is, $f:\mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}.$)
